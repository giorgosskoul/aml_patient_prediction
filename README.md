The FlowCAP cytometry dataset was used in the DREAM6/FlowCAP2/Molecular Classification of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) Challenge in 2011. 
As part of a group assignment for my Introduction to Data Science course, I contributed to training a Random Forest model for the FlowCAP dataset, achieving second place in a class competition.
